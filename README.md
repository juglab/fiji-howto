# How to do things in Fiji from Java

Here we will collect code snippets of common tasks any Java developer might face while extending or developing *ImageJ / Fiji*.
 

## How to contribute:
- create issues for missing tasks
- solve tasks by creating a PR or commenting on the issue
- have a look at existing solutions and notify us in case there is a better strategy

## Rules for new solutions:
- each class covers one how-to containing a static method demonstrating the solution
- in case there are multiple recommended strategies, the class contains multiple static methods
- no legacy code in case there is a newer strategy
- no utility methods / classes
